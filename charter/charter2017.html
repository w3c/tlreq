<h1 id="title">DRAFT Tibetan Text Layout Task Force Charter</h1>
<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task
  force is to document requirements for the layout and
  presentation of text in languages written in the Tibetan script,
  when those languages are used by Web standards and technologies,
  such as HTML, CSS, SVG, Mobile Web, Digital Publications and
  Unicode. </p>
<p class="mission"><em>This in an informal charter, and can be changed at any time if the Task Force members are in agreement. It serves to clarify the intended direction of the group.</em></p>
<p class="mission">In addition to China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region, the script is widely used in Bhutan, Nepal, India and throughout the Tibetan diaspora. Requirements for these regions are also included in the scope of the document,
  and participation in this work by those communities is welcomed.
  This task force will gather and integrate feedback from the
  participating members about the need for and technical
  feasibility of various requirements.</p>
<p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the Internationalization Interest Group.</p>
<p class="mission">The aim of this Task Force is to follow the
  example of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements
    for Japanese Text Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/elreq/"> Ethiopic Layout Requirements</a>, and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/alreq/">Arabic Layout Requirements</a>,
  and collect information about specific use cases for technologies
  defined in various Web specifications as they relate to the
  Tibetan script. The Task Force will report the results of its
  activities as a group back to the Internationalization Working Group,
  as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and
  community.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<h3>Primary objective</h3>
<p>The main objective of the task force is to document
  typographic and layout requirements for languages using the
  <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> script. These requirements should be met in Web
  standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, SVG, and
  Digital Publication technologies.</p>
<p>Use of the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> script extends beyond the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> language.
   Although these languages and writing
  traditions are important, the initial focus of this Task Force
  will be on the usage associated with the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> language. This can be changed at any time, if expert contributors representing other languages are able to contribute to the Task Force.</p>
  <h3>Optional additional items</h3>
<p>In addition to those technologies mentioned above, the group may review (but is by no means explicitly limited to reviewing) the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The work of the Internationalization Working Group.</li>
  <li>CSS3 Modules, in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>CSS3 Writing Modes Working Draft</li>
      <li>CSS3 Text</li>
      <li>CSS3 Lists</li>
      <li>CSS3 Fonts</li>      
      <li>CSS3 Counter Styles</li>

    </ul></li>
  <li>HTML (in particular references to bidi, locale-specific formats, and other internationalization aspects)</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with reviewing the above mentioned specifications and related specifications,  the group will also gather comments and questions about those specifications, collect information about specific use cases affecting the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> script for technologies defined in those specifications or browser implementations, and report the results of its activities as a group back to the Internationalization Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups - such as the HTML Working Group, CSS Working Group, SVG Working Group, and other Working Groups at the W3C as needed. It can also link to discussions about gaps between the requirements and the implementations from the Typography Index maintained by the Internationalization Working Group.</p>

<h3>Initial set of languages</h3>
<p>Initial set of languages to be covered consists of <span class="mission">Tibetan</span>.
  Information regarding other languages will be included based
  on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts.</p>
<div>
  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
  <h3>Main deliverables</h3>
  <p>Target deliverable is the document <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Script Layout
    Requirements.</p>
  <p>The <span class="mission">Tibetan</span>  Layout Task Force will not produce
    Recommendation-track deliverables but will produce documents
    that can be published by the Internationalization Working
    Group as Working Group Notes about text layout and
    typography in the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> script.</p>
    <h3>Optional deliverables</h3>
    <p>The group may also choose to produce other non-normative deliverables, such as test cases and bug reports â€“ under the terms of the Policies for Contribution of Test Cases to W3C, and in coordination with any relevant working groups, browser vendors or application developers. </p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>Plans for the main document deliverable are as follows. All deliverables will be made available in English.</p>

</table>
<p>Other deliverables may be produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the task force and schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by the needs of the Web community.</div>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
<p>The success of the Task Force will be evaluated based on how
  productively it engages with W3C members and the relevant
  script communities to promote discussion of specifications
  that affect layout and presentation of languages on the Web,
  and how effectively it is able to produce additional documents
  for the refinement, implementation, and adoption of text
  layout and related technologies in Hebrew.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Relationships to External Groups</h2>

<p>Working Drafts and Notes will be published by the i18n WG, and the i18n WG will work with the task force closely to assist with development and review of the documents.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>The <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Layout Task Force has no formal
    dependencies on any W3C Working Groups other than the
    Internationalization Working Group. Important points of
    contact are:</dt>
  <dd>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization Activity</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">CSS Working Group</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode Consortium</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG Working Group</a></li> 
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a></li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Other Groups</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Layout Task Force is also expected to take
    advantage of opportunities for discussion and collaboration
    with existing groups and communities in China as well as
    interested groups and communities elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>To be successful, the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Layout Task Force is
  expected to have participation or contributions, for its duration, from a
  representative section of the typographic and digital text
  publishing communities for each of the main languages covered.
  Effective participation in the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Layout Task Force
  is expected to consume up to one work day per week for each
  participant; two days per week for editors.</p>
<p>Participants are reminded of the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
<p>People contributing substantive text to the deliverables must be public invited experts or work for W3C member organizations, in order to meet the policy requirements of section 7 of this charter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p><span class="mission">Tibetan</span>  Layout Task Force discussions take place via  github, teleconferences and email, and face-to-face meetings may be called at locations
  that are convenient to participants in the project. Any
  publications or other reports eventually contributed by the
  Task Force back to the W3C will be made available in English.
  (Translations may be produced in addition to the English
  version, but the English version will remain the authoritative
  version.)</p>
<p>The task force reaches out to the wider international
  community with discussions and announcements in English on the public-i18n-tibetan@w3.org list (<a
            href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-hebrew/">archive</a>).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That list will be used for technical discussions, where
  necessary, but the group will use github issues to handle most
  technical or editorial comments and discussions. The public-i18n-tibetan@w3.org list must archive or point to
  minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face
  meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given
  meeting.</p>
<p>An administrative list, public-i18n-tlreq-admin, will also be
  used for internal communication about practical matters, such
  as meeting agenda, which should be published before each
  teleconference or face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>The group will use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/"> Internationalization Activity home page </a>to provide updated public information about its activities.
</p>
<p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
  face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available
  from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization
    
    
    
    
    
    Working Group</a> home page and from the  <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/International/groups/hebrew-layout">home
      
      
      
      
      
      page of the Task Force</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>
<p>Participants in the <span class="mission">Tibetan</span> Layout Task Force are
  obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as

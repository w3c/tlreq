# Tibetan Layout Task Force

This group is planned, but not yet active. It will exist to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Tibetan script on the Web and in eBooks.

It aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which provides a heat-map for language issues on the Web.  You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=tlreq) page. (That link applies a `tlreq` filter.)

For more details about scope, deliverables, work methods, etc., see the [group's charter](https://w3c.github.io/tlreq/charter/).

### Feedback
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

Note that the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is used to send notification digests & meeting minutes. It is **not** for technical discussion.


### Participate
You can participate in the task force work at various levels. In order of increasing commitment, these include Follower, Contributor, Participant, Editor, and Chair. [Find your level](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles).

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document provides information about the Tibetan script as used for the Tibetan and Dzongka languages as used in China, Bhutan, India, and the Tibetan diaspora.</p>

<p>The document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

<section id="h_gap_analysis">
<h3>Gap analysis</h3>

<p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tibt-gap/">Tibetan Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Tibetan orthographies on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>

<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. Those requirements can be described here.</p>

<p>As gaps in support for Tibetan are captured, the gap is brought to the attention of the relevant spec developer or browser implementation community. The progress of such work is tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/projects/3?card_filter_query=label%3Ax%3Atibt">Gap Analysis Pipeline</a>.</p>

<h3>Other related resources</h3>

<p>The initial material for this document was an edited extract from the page <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tibt/bo.html">Tibetan orthography notes</a>. That page contains additional details about character usage and how the writing system works, plus interactive information, which are not available here.</p>
<p>Some additional information was based on a <a href="https://www.chinaw3c.org/layout-workshop-report.html#talk5">talk by Jianxin Yin</a>.</p>

<p>The document <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/">Language enablement index</a> points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>

<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to GitHub issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="language_overview">
<h2><span its-locale-filter-list="en">Tibetan script overview</span></h2>

<p>There are various different Tibetan orthographies, falling into two basic types: <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="bo">དབུ་ཅན</span> <span class="transc">dbu can</span></span>, pronounced <span class="ipa">uchen</span> (<span class="meaning">with a head</span>), and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="bo">དབུ་མེད</span> <span class="transc">dbu med</span></span>, pronounced <span class="ipa">ume</span> (<span class="meaning">headless</span>). This page concentrates on the former. Pronunciations are based on the central, Lhasa dialect.</p>

<p>Historically, Tibetan text was written on loose-leaf sheets called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha">pechas</a>, ( <span class="charExample" translate="no"><bdi class="ex" lang="bo">དཔེ་ཆ</bdi> <bdi class="ipa">pé.t͡ɕʰá</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">book, scripture</bdi></span> ). Some of the characters used and formatting approaches are different in books and pechas.</p>


<p>Tibetan text runs left to right in horizontal lines.</p>

<p>Words boundaries are not indicated. However, Tibetan words are made up of one or more units called <span class="name">tsheg-bar</span> which are roughly equivalent to phonological syllables. <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="bo">&#x0F0B;</bdi> <span class="uname">U+0F0B TIBETAN MARK INTERSYLLABIC TSHEG</span></span> is used after the <span class="name">tsheg-bar</span> to show the boundaries.</p>

<p class="addToConsonants">These <span class="name">tsheg-bar</span> units are composed of  structural elements that include vowel signs and consonants used as prefixes, root characters, subscripts, superscripts, suffixes, and secondary suffixes. A common realisation includes a stack and additional consonants to either side of the root consonant. These may indicate syllable-final consonant sounds, but more often than not they qualify or modify the root value, and are not associated with their nominal sound value. The actual pronunciation is usually much more simple than a transliteration would suggest.  For example, the word  <span class="charExample inline" translate="no"><bdi class="ex" lang="bo">བཀོད</bdi> <bdi class="ipa">kǿː</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">to create</bdi></span> is transcribed as <span class="transc">bkod</span>.</p>

<figcaption>The single-syllable word <span class="charExample" translate="no"><bdi class="ipa">cy᷈ː</bdi> <bdi class="meaning">string</bdi></span> with an initial stack of three consonants plus a vowel sign. followed by a suffix consonant (to the right).</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="addToConsonants">To write the sounds of the standard Lhasa dialect, Tibetan uses 30 consonant letters (plus their subjoined forms). 6 more letters are used to write Sanskrit.</p>

<p class="addToConsonants">A  distinguishing feature of Tibetan is the set of separate code points for subjoined consonants, used to create consonant stacks. Of the 77 combining characters in the Tibetan block, 48 represent subjoined consonant forms. Unlike many other Indic scripts, the modern Tibetan orthography doesn't use a <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-virama">virama</a> to create stacks.</p>

<p class="addToVowels">Tibetan is an <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-abugida">abugida</a> with one <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-inherent-vowel">inherent vowel</a>. When writing the Lhasa dialect, other post-consonant vowels are represented using 4 <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-vowel-sign">vowel signs</a>, all combining marks.</p>
<p class="addToVowels">There are no <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-pre-base">pre-base</a>, <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-circumgraph">circumgraph</a>, or <a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-composite-vowel">multipart vowels</a> in the Tibetan used to write the Llasa dialect (though there are when writing in Sanskrit).</p>

<p class="addToVowels"><a class="termref" href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-glossary/index.html#dfn-standalone-vowel">Standalone vowels</a> are written by adding vowel signs to either <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="bo">&#x0F60;</bdi> <span class="uname">U+0F60 TIBETAN LETTER -A</span></span> or  <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="bo">&#x0F68;</bdi> <span class="uname">U+0F68 TIBETAN LETTER A</span></span>, depending on the tone.</p>

<p class="addToVowels"><em>Sanskrit</em> vowels written in Tibetan use additional vowel signs and combining marks, some of which represent diphthongs, and some of which form circumgraphs or multipart characters, depending on the encoding.</p>

<p class="addToVowels">Tone is not explicitly indicated in the orthography.</p>

<p>Modern Tibetan writing uses few punctuation marks or symbols, but the Tibetan script block in Unicode contains many of these.</p>

<p>Tibetan has its own set of numbers.</p>

	  <p its-locale-filter-list="en">At the end of a topic the rules say that only one shay should be converted, ie. <span class="ex" style="white-space:nowrap;" lang="bo">༑  །</span>, however it is moderately popular to convert both, ie. <span class="ex" style="white-space:nowrap;" lang="bo">༑ ༑</span>. This change serves as an optical indication that there is a left-over syllable at the beginning of the line that actually belongs to the preceding line. </p>
	  <p its-locale-filter-list="en">This varies in the following cases:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p its-locale-filter-list="en">when a line starts with <span class="ex" style="white-space:nowrap;" lang="bo">ལེའུ། །</span>, no rin chen spungs shad would be used, since <span class="ipa">le'u</span> is pronounced as two syllables.</p></li>
	    <li><p its-locale-filter-list="en">sometimes  only the first of two shays is replaced, ie. <span class="ex" style="white-space:nowrap;" lang="bo">༑ །</span>, but this style is considered less attractive.</p></li>
	    <li> <p its-locale-filter-list="en">some printed books do not use rin chen spungs shad replacements, however the majority of books  apply the same rules as are used with pechas.</p></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p its-locale-filter-list="en">In an environment where the width or content of the page can change, this feature poses a problem for the content author. The application needs to be able to automatically switch between the two styles of shad as a syllable moves on or off a new line when the page is resized or when preceding content is modified.</p>
	  <p its-locale-filter-list="en">The Unicode Standard adds: "Not only is rin-chen-spungs-shad used as the replacement for the shay but a whole class of “ornamental shays ” are used for the same purpose.
